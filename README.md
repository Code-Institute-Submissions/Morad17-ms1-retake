#   Amur Leopard

This projcet was designed to supercede my previous work, cut out the outdated and unresponsive code, whilst retaining the main message and purpose of the project.
The project can be viewed here: [link](https://morad17.github.io/ms1-retake/)
The amur leopard is one of the most endangered species in the world, which requires protection for the survival of its species.
The purpose of this website is two-fold: raise awareness of the vunerability of the Amur Leopard, why its vunerable, info on the animal, and to pursuade people to sign up
monthly for packages to sponser the Amur Leopard

## UX

The UX of the website is designed to cater to all users; Ipad Phone and PC users. By doing this I can maximse the donations I can 
receive from custoers, which is the main purpost of the website. There are many images in the webpage, which helps to deliver emotive
feeling that can persuade people to sign up. I have fixed previous errors in the css, added media queries to make sure the ux is perfect on all screens.
## User Stories

2. As a returning user I want to have a clear website so I can go to the specific page I am looking for
3. As a returning user I want the latest info on how the Leopards are doing and their threat rate.
## wireframe

For this project I used a wireframe to help build up an idea of what I was going to crate this can be seen here "https://www.figma.com/file/TCIY2lrHYKOjHoMuWlofXV/Code-Project?node-id=5%3A75"
This is a simple wireframe that helps me build on the thoughts and ideas I have for the website.
## Features

The feature I have implemented include:

## Sign Up
A sign up form for the user, where they can build an account with us to receive updates and help them come back to the website
A adoption sign up page to descrive the packages available and persuade them to sign up in the long-term

A feature I am looking to implement in the future is a progress tracker so the user can see how close we are to reaching our goals

## Social links
Social links have been provided at the bottom in a clear format so users can spread the message On all social platforms.

## testing

## User Stories
User Goal | Outcome
----------|---------

I would like a responsive layout so I can view the information on my Ipad | The layout has been updated so no bugs appear on the Ipad and other screen sizes

I would like to be able to see all the relavant packages that I can sponsor, and what I get for that package| A clear broze silve and gold system has been added to tell the user what they will receive depending on the package

### General Testing 

"the Ipad screen looks reall glicky"
this has been rectified with simple css and media query to stop the images escaping the line

"I cant see the links on my phone screen"
Another bug, this has been rectified using a burger toggler, when the screen drops to a certain size.

### Responsive design

Care was taken to make the page 'user friendly' on all devices, the man resolutions that were tested were:
1. 'Iphone 6/7/8'
2. 'Ipad / Ipad Pro'
3. Standard Computer resolution

## Language used

I have used Bootstrap, css, and Html to create this webpage, Bootstrao has helped to make the pages completely user friendly no 
matter the size of the display being used. 

I have used Wikipedia mainly for the factual information regarding the Amur Leopard, such as locaton etc.
Google Images have been used in the webpage which has helped to deliver great illustrations to the site, but not included copyrighted material
WWF.org.uk has been a big inspiration in creating the webpage, it has helped to give a heading and and idea on how to be more
persuasive with the imagery and the text


## Deployment
I have depoyed my code onto GitHub for viewing/testing. Also the project can be viewed on github pages on [link](https://morad17.github.io/ms1-retake/).
