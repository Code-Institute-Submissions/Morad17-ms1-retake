                    Amur Leopard Conservation 
                </h2>
                <p>
                The Amur Leopard is considered one of the most endagered species to date, with only around
                84 individuals in the wild. It therefore needs our help to rebuild its population. The underlying
                cause of the small population is there low genetic variation, which can cause complications in 
                breeding process. Besides this many external influences has cause the decline of the breed, such
                as: Poaching, Human Interaction and Habitat Loss. These can all be attributed to humans and therfore
                its up to us to make the changes to not lot let this creature go extinct

                <h4>  
                Habitat Loss
                </h4>
   
                <p>
                Arguably the biggest factor affecting the Amur Leopard is the destruction of their habitat. The Amur
                Leopard is situated in one area; the Primorye region of southeastern Russia and northern China. 
                Between 1970 and 1983, 80 percent of the Amur leopard's habitat was lost due to logging, forest fires, 
                and agricultural land conversion projects. This no only destroys the homes of the leopard, but also the 
                prey that it feed on, which is mainly deer, but also includes roe deer, sika deer, badgers and hares. 
                Pressure on gouvernements and local authorities is needed to decrease deforestation and habitat loss.

                <h4>
                Poaching
                </h4> 
                <p>
                Another key factor killing the Leopard is Poaching. Amur Leopards are killed fro their beautiful, dotted, fur skins
                and sold on the black market for a high price. In 14 months from February 2002 to April 2003, seven skins or part of 
                skins were confiscated, six in Russia and one in China. The Amur Leopard is also used in some Chinese medicines, with their
                bones, when crushed up, is said to heal certain ailments. These practices are banned but not enforced by the Gouvernmental 
                bodies in the area.

        <p>Some of the investement we receive will go to projects with nationals zoos.
         These projects help in many ways, such as funding tests and research into the Amur leopard, in order to
         better understand the creature. Another is to help in increasing the poppulation of the Leopard. This is cruical
         in order to bring the creature out of near extincion</p>

        <img class="img-fluid goal-img"src="images/government.jpg" alt=" ">
        <p>One of the most important aspect is to keep pressure on the Government. This in part can be through media;
        shareing our stories through social media can help to increase pressure on local authoritied and in turn lead to 
        the Governmental bodies taking the situation more seriour</p>

        <p>Some of the investement we receive will go to the protection of Leopards in the conservation area. This area is 
        protected from poachers, looking to skin and kill the Leopards. There is round the clock protection, with cctv and 
        guards, helping to deter intruders. Inverstment will also go to the training of these guards</p>

        <img class="img-fluid goal-img"src="images/randd.jpeg" alt=" ">
        <p>This is a key project to help the Leopards. Money will be going into helping develop cures for the Amur Leopards genetic defects.
        Any research that can help with the ailing genetic problems of the Amur Leopard will help us to increase their numbers, through 
        diversifying the gene pool. This will also help long term goals as it will increse the likelyhood of the breed thriving in the wild.
